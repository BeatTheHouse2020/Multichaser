Multichaser is basically a platform script that can be used in many ways based on your risk tolerance.

The script monitors specific cashouts (that you can add more to if needed) and patiently waits for the right time to bet on that cashout.

So by default it monitors about 30-40 cashouts I believe. For Example 1.5,2,3,3.5,4,4.5........1000x, 2000x

The way the script determines when to bet on the cashout is based on two things. #1. Balance, #2. Your Streak Survival Game.

For example:

If your 2x streak survival game is 22 (worst streak in bab history is 21 < 2x in a row over the last 3.5 years) and you have 1024 bits then the script would determine that you can only bet 10 times. Since its 2x it has to double each bet after a loss. So 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512 = 1023  and thats 10 games. So the script will take your survival game #22 subtract the 10 games to determine that based on your balance you can only start betting after 12 < 2x in a row for that cashout.

So the only way to lose is if your survival game is broken for any cashout that your script is monitoring on.

Each cashout has their own increase amount as if you are chasing a 12x you dont need to double your bet each time you increase it by 1.090909. The script is smart enough to know how to calculate the bet increase for any cashout.
